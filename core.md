### Skills

Each skill is a workflow that you teach Autotab and that it can then perform. For instance, you might have a skill to update your CRM every week, or a skill to process outstanding customer orders.

### Steps

Each skill is made up of steps. Each step is a single action that Autotab will perform. For instance, you might have a step to open a web page, to click the search button or to draft an email. As you record a skill, Autotab learns the steps. You can see the steps as Autotab learns them to verify that Autotab learned correctly, and edit any steps if necessary.

### Scrubber

The scrubber is the orange bar in the left sidepanel. Similar to the scrubber in a video player, the scrubber marks the current position in the skill. You can click between any two steps to move the scrubber there.

### Scratchpad

The scratchpad is where Autotab stores all the data context from the steps in a run. It is kind of like the clipboard (copy/paste) except that adding new data does not overwrite existing data. You can see the scratchpad contents by clicking on the document icon at the top left when a skill is open (to the right of the big play button). Once data is added to the scratchpad, you can teach Autotab to paste that data elsewhere. Autotab can also take actions based on the data, e.g. click the search result that best matches the profile we found on the other page.
