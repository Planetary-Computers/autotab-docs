Autotab is designed with two main goals:

1. **Reliability**: Autotab is built with an extreme focus on hallucination-proof reliabilityâ€“it must complete your task correctly, every single time.
2. **Ease of use**: Autotab's users are domain experts, not software engineers. Teaching Autotab should feel like teaching a human teammate, not writing code.

### Skills

Autotab learns specific skills, which contain all the context about the task and how Autotab should perform it. For instance, you might have a skill to update your CRM every week, or a skill to process outstanding customer orders.

### Steps

Each skill contains a list of steps, which provide the instructions Autotab will follow to complete the task. For instance, you might have a step to open a web page, to click the search button or to draft an email.

As you record a skill, Autotab learns new steps. You can see the steps to verify that Autotab learned them correctly, and edit any steps if necessary.

### Scrubber

The scrubber is the orange bar in the left sidepanel. Similar to the scrubber in a video player, the scrubber marks the current position in the skill. You can click between any two steps to move the scrubber there.

### Scratchpad

The scratchpad is where Autotab stores all the data context from the steps in a run. It is kind of like the clipboard (copy/paste) except that adding new data does not overwrite existing data. You can see the scratchpad contents by clicking on the document icon at the top left when a skill is open (to the right of the big play button).

Once data is added to the scratchpad, you can teach Autotab to use that data as context: to paste it into a form, use it to reason about what to do next or take actions based on the data (e.g. click the search result that best matches the name we found on the other page).
