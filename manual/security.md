## Secure Sync

By default, you can securely sync your Autotab session data to a secure enclave on your cloud nodes. Your passwords never leave your device, and no one else can portal into your nodes without your permission.

## Secrets

You can also pass secrets as inputs when you run a Skill. These are encrypted in transit and at rest and are never stored outside of your secure enclave. They are also never used in any model inference steps.
