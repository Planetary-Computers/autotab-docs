# Files

Autotab automatically tracks files downloaded in the [scratchpad](/manual/scratchpad) and makes them available to later steps to read or upload elsewhere.

If have a file available on your device, the easiest way to have Autotab access it is to upload it to a storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox.

## Loading Files

Certain types of files can be opened by Autotab internally, making their contents available to later steps. Currently, Autotab can open CSV and text files, with support for PDF and Excel files coming soon.

## File Uploads

Once Autotab has downloaded a file, just record yourself uploading it the way you normally would. Autotab will automatically ask you which of the available files you want to upload.
