Inputs are data that you pass into a skill before running it.

## Secrets

Inputs can be marked as secret. Secret inputs will not be shown in the UI, will not be saved in the logs, and will not be sent to any models.

Use secret inputs for sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or other credentials.

export const EmbeddedVideo = ({ children, url }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      position: "relative",
      paddingBottom: "62.456140350877185%",
      height: 0,
      marginBottom: "var(--ifm-leading)",
    }}
  >
    {children}
    <iframe
      src={url}
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
);
<EmbeddedVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/f4ee24df92024991b1cc7c5ca2dc22a5?sid=2c157140-a721-443a-9114-e5283864c591"></EmbeddedVideo>;

## Structured data

If you have structured data you want to use as an input (e.g. a list of LinkedIn profile urls), you can select "Load as data" when creating the input.
For an input that has already been created, you can create a "Reasoning" step that references the input and write a prompt like "Load the data from @input".
