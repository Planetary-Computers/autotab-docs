Inputs are data that you pass into a skill before running it.

## Structured data

If you have structured data you want to use as an input (e.g. a list of LinkedIn profile urls), you can select "Load as data" when creating the input.
For an input that has already been created, you can create a "Reasoning" step that references the input and write a prompt like "Load the data from @input".
