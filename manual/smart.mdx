## Getting smart

Sometimes the element Autotab needs to interact with changes based on the context. For example, a patient intake form might specify a patient's age as a number, but the form Autotab is entering the age into is a selection between 5 different age ranges.

To record a Smart Click, first click and drag over the area that has all the elements you might want Autotab to click on.

Then select "Smart Click" and describe what you want Autotab to do. You can reference variables from the scratchpad by using the `@` symbol.
