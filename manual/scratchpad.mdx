Autotab's scratchpad is how it remembers information across steps. Some steps can add data to the scratchpad, while other steps can insert data from the scratchpad into the page. There are also steps that allow your skills to do different things based on the data in the scratchpad.

## Basics

You can reference data from the scratchpad by typing @ followed by the name of the data you want to reference.
Skills can also have inputs which is data that you pass into the skill before running it. Data from inputs is also stored in the scratchpad for Autotab to reference in the skill.
