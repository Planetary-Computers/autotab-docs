## Connect Google Sheets

There are a few different ways to have Autotab work through rows in a spreadsheet. The most straightforward way is to have Autotab download the spreadsheet as a CSV file, and then load that as a data. Here's a short demonstration:

export const EmbeddedVideo = ({ children, url }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      position: "relative",
      paddingBottom: "62.456140350877185%",
      height: 0,
      marginBottom: "var(--ifm-leading)",
    }}
  >
    {children}
    <iframe
      src={url}
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
);

<EmbeddedVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/6cd4e670be5748c79a3e9b471018e319?sid=299b0798-1dd8-4283-a72a-a0aaa39368e0"></EmbeddedVideo>{" "}

The process for Excel is the same, except you would download the file from Dropbox/Box/Google Drive/etc. instead of from Google Sheets.
