# Running your Skills

You may run your skills locally, or in the cloud. You can also trigger runs manually, or put them on a schedule (for cloud runs).

# Local runs

In order to run Autotab locally, we recommend updating your settings to allow Autotab to run even when you are away from your computer.

First, open **System Settings**, navigate to **Battery** or **Energy** (for Desktop), and go to **Options**.

<img

  src="/images/prevent-sleep-options.png"
  alt="Navigate to Battery/Energy and click Options"
/>

Then enable "Prevent automatic sleeping on power adapter when the display is off".

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/prevent-sleep-toggle.png"
  alt="Toggle pevent automatic sleeping"
/>

That's it! You're all set to run Autotab locally.
