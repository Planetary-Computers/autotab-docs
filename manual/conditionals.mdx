To record a conditional step, follow these steps:

1. Click the orange plus button on the Scrubber in the sidepanel and select "Conditional".
2. Describe what condition you'd like Autotab to check for. As always, you can reference variables using the `@` symbol.
3. Click save!

Now that your conditional step is created, you can add steps below the conditional. Any steps that are below the conditional and indented will only be run if the condition is met.

When a conditional step is run, you can see if Autotab thought the condition applied or not by the color of the dot next to the step. A green dot means Autotab thought the condition was true and will run the indented steps. A red dot means Autotab thought the condition was false and will skip the indented steps.
