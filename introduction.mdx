# About Autotab

Autotab is a drop-in system for scaling repetitive processes that previously required humans, especially complex tasks that require reasoning and using multiple different apps.

You teach Autotab how to do a task just like you would a human teammate: by walking it through your workflow and explaining the steps as you go.

Once Autotab has learned a task, it can run it as many times as needed, 24/7, with better-than-human reliability.

## Setting up

Teach Autotab new skills with the [Desktop App](https://autotab.com). You can run Autotab on demand, set up a schedule, or trigger Autotab via the API.
