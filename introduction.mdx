# Getting Started

Autotab is the first digital robot that can learn and work like a human, using mouse and keyboard to do your repetitive work for you. You teach Autotab how to do a task just like you would a human teammate: by walking it through your workflow and explaining the steps as you go.

Once a task is learned, Autotab can run it as many times as needed, 24/7, with better-than-human reliability.

## Setting up

Teach Autotab new skills with the [Desktop App](https://autotab.com), integrate the API to run them on-demand.
