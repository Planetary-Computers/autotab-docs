Autotab is great at moving data between systems. For instance, Autotab can extract information from an insurance portal, e.g. payment history or prior authorizations.

In this example, Autotab is getting a list of reservations to make from a Google Sheet. It then goes to OpenTable and makes each reservation 1 by 1, confirming that each reservation was made successfully before moving on to the next one.
