Autotab can onboard new employees by automating the process of creating their accounts, setting up their email, and adding them to the company's Slack channel.

In this example, Autotab is going through the list of employee onboarding tasks in Trello, and completing each task for each new employee. Tasks include adding them to Hubspot and Slack, as well as sending them a welcome email.
