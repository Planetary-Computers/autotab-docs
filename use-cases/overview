Autotab is becoming more capable every day. If you're just getting started with Autotab, here are some examples of the types of tasks that are easiest to start with:

- **Repetitive tasks**: Tasks that are repetitive are great because you can show Autotab how to do them once and then let it run them as many times as needed.
- **Tasks that involve using multiple apps**: Autotab uses a browser to perform tasks, so it can easily interact with multiple apps (e.g. cross-reference, copy/paste, etc. across apps).
- **Tasks with simple context**: It's easiest to get started with tasks where Autotab can quickly understand the context needed to perform the task well.
