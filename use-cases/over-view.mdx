Autotab is becoming more capable every day. If you're just getting started with Autotab, here are some examples of the types of tasks that are easiest to start with:

- **Repetitive tasks**: Tasks that are repetitive are great because you can show Autotab how to do them once and then let it run them as many times as needed.
- **Tasks that involve using multiple apps**: Autotab uses a browser to perform tasks, so it can easily interact with multiple apps (e.g. cross-reference, copy/paste, etc. across apps).
- **Tasks with simple context**: It's easiest to get started with tasks where Autotab can quickly understand the context needed to perform the task well.

## Examples

### Collecting data

Autotab is great at collecting data from websites. Compared to other solutions, it can handle much more complex extraction tasks.

export const EmbeddedVideo = ({ children, url }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      position: "relative",
      paddingBottom: "62.456140350877185%",
      height: 0,
      marginBottom: "var(--ifm-leading)",
    }}
  >
    {children}
    <iframe
      src={url}
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
);

### Form filling/updating systems

Autotab can also update data across systems, using reasoning to correctly enter data into the most complicated dynamic systems.

### Taking action

Autotab is not restricted to moving data around, it can also take actions on websites. Examples include sending messages, booking appointments, and connecting with people on social networks.
