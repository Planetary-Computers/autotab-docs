description: "Autotab can update your system of record, e.g. your CMS, ERP, CRM, TMS, etc."

Autotab is great at moving data between systems, e.g. updating systems of record like a content management system (CMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), or electronic health records (EHR/EMR).

In this example, a warehouse audit of a company's inventory was recorded in a spreadsheet. Autotab updates the company's CMS with the new inventory levels, and sends alerts in cases where inventory levels are low.
